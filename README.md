KeyDaemon
=============
About
---------
This is a proof of concept prank for remotely messing with a target's keyboard and mouse. Using an Arduino Leonardo to act as an HID and an ESP8266 to act as a RESTful API endpoint, remote users can access the API either directly or using the included Python class. There's even an interactive mode for immediate results.
